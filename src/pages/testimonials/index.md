      "I was apprehensive being a novice to yoga. However, from my very first
      class Jess has been extremely professional and patient. Jess has built my
      confidence and enabled me to push boundaries. Every worry and concern
      leaves my mind, as I focus on deeper breaths I never knew existed and
      channeling into my body in new ways. Jess offers a supportive and
      spiritual class which has ignited a real passion for yoga within me, thank
      you for being an amazing teacher and sharing your expertise!"

      “Studying and taking private yoga classes with Jess has had a significant
      impact on my personal yoga practice, as well as my core posture. Always
      encouraged to approach postures in an intelligent, conscious manner, I’m
      far more aware of the subtleties of what we’re asking our bodies to do,
      and of healthy anatomical alignment. Jess is also totally approachable and
      genuinely giving with her great knowledge and experience”
