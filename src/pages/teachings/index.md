My teaching is focused in three areas; connection, creativity, empowerment which are encompassed within The Light Tree philosophy.

The tree is the realisation of the seed. Plant the seed, feed and water it, give it sunlight and the tree will grow strong and healthy. Our thoughts and intentions are the seeds of our life.

Just like a tree, from each root to every leaf, everything is connected. We are connected to everything through energy, we are a unique manifestation of that energy in matter form. The outer world we experience is simply a reflection of our inner experience.

Through our Yoga practice we become more aware of and connected to our true inner self, we rediscover our voice and grow confidence as we begin to understand how we create our lives through awareness and choice and learn how to empower ourselves to bring into action the life that better serves us, those around us and the world as a whole. We shine our light.

### Connection

Through our Yoga practice we embark on an inner journey of self-enquiry exploring our bodies and minds not only on a physical level but also mental/emotional, energetic and soulful levels, uncovering new clarity and deepening our connection to our true Self.  In turn allowing us to connect in a more meaningful way with our experience of life, to the people in our lives, the environment around us and to the wider human race and all living things.  

### Creativity 

As humans we have been blessed with an innate ability to create. By tapping into this ability through our practice we access the power of choice and when combined with self-enquiry we can learn how to move from ‘reaction’ to ‘response’ in each moment, bringing more balance and flow to our experience. This can be incredibly healing and the platform from which we can discover our voice and the confidence to begin to create lives that are more centred in peace and joy, being of more service to those around us, being of contribution to our collective experience.

### Empower

As our practice develops we begin discover new things about our interaction with our Self and the world around us by what we question, explore, practice and action on the mat. With regular practice we become more fluent and when combined with connection and creativity this approach translates and shows up off the mat empowering us with a new sense of self-sufficiency, confidence and purpose.
