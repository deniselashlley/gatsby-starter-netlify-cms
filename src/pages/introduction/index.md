  Hi, my name is Jess and welcome to The Light Tree. 


  Whatever your age, shape, size, ethnicity, social background, whether you want
  to strengthen your body or create more flexibility, maybe you are looking for
  some time for yourself or learn how to be calmer, you could be on a journey of
  self-realisation, Yoga is a system of transformation that can be accessed by
  everyone. 


  I run group classes, workshops and private sessions for all abilities and I am
  passionate about helping you to energise your body, calm your mind, nourish
  your soul and shine your light.

  “You cannot solve a problem from the same level of consciousness that created
  it” - Albert Einstein
